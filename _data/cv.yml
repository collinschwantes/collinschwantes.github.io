        - Build and support the culture, infrastructure, skills, and strategies necessary to have collaborative, reproducible, and open science be the norm at EcoHealth Alliance. 
        - Lead the transformation of data management by developing strategic plans, emphasizing flexible planning at the project level, and creating integrated and collaborative systems that unify laboratory, field, and qualitative data streams across multiple international institutions in different resource settings. 
        - Write software in R (90%), Javascript (8%), and Python (2%) to facilitate open research. 
        - Create, curate, and teach a collection of materials on cutting edge research reproducibility tools and FAIR/CARE practices.
        - Streamline, integrate, and maintain organizational data that capture and disseminate institutional knowledge. 
        - Provide on-demand technical support across multiple projects for software testing, automated data curation, data integration, data imputation, geospatial analyses, and graph analytics.
    - title: Data Scientist
      institution: Accenture Federal Services, Washington, DC
      year: 2019-2021
      description:
        - Rapidly develop and deploy data science applications to solve analytics problems for the United States government. 
        - Data Science Craft lead. Help data scientists within the Discovery Lab thrive by connecting them with resources, building best practices, and creating a supportive development community. 
        - Lead COVID-19 modeling efforts. Develop and deploy near real time forecasting models, phase classification algorithms based on CDC guidance, and a network based COVID-19 office simulation. These products provided essential information via cloud based solutions to leadership at three major government agencies and two fortune 500 companies. 
        - Data visualization expert who uses human centered design techniques to generate insightful and ergonomic tools for exploring data.   
        - Developed an R-python hybrid application to improve search results and usability of contracting documents with completeness and quality issues. The application uses a semantic search based on the BERT algorithm and a graph database to overcome the inconsistencies in the underlying documents.      
        - Lead Graph Analytics Community of Interest. Build and nurture expertise in graph analytics and semantic data with colleagues across Accenture Federal Services, leading directly to business applications of advanced graph analytics methods.

    - title: Biosurveillance Scientist
      institution: Accenture Federal Services, Washington, DC
      year: 2016-2021
      description:
        - Integrate open source health surveillance data from multiple jurisdictions to provide situational awareness for emerging infectious diseases in animals, plants, and people.
        - Champion reproducible research best practices.
        - Lead geospatial analysis efforts, train team members to use GIS systems, and provide subject matter expertise on geospatial data standards to ensure interoperability of systems developed by the client.    
        - Write flexible programs in R to parse unstructured or semi-structured text and image based data for use in analyses. This improves reproducibility of analyses, facilitates data sharing, and reduces person hours dedicated to data entry.
        - Produce data visualizations used in in-depth reports, communications materials, and congressional/leadership briefings.
        - Test prototype applications in multiple spaces including epidemiological forecasting and natural language processing of medical text.
