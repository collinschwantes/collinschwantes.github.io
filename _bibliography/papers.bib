@inproceedings{schwantes_integrating_2021,title={"{Integrating} {COVID} {Models} at {Different} {Scales} for {Infection} {Risk} {Estimation} and {Control} {Optimization}"},url={https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/trecms/pdf/AD1187600.pdf},abstract={SARS-COV-2 infections result from interactions at fine spatial and temporal scales;
however, case clusters occur within a larger scale epidemiological context. Appropriately
integrating the interactions between processes that occur across spatial and temporal
scales is essential for simulating systems of disease transmission and understanding
infection risk. Here we present a simulation engine that places a fine scale network based
infection model within the broader epidemiological context of the study population. Using
this system, we are able to simulate seeding events and fully explore the control strategy
space.
Our simulation engine can integrate a spatially explicit COVID-19 case estimation technique
at the county scale with institution level disease transmission at a “building” scale. The case
estimation technique takes into account location specific factors around infection control
and population level movement to estimate disease burden in a given location. The
institution level model uses a multigraph to integrate social and spatial contact networks
under various hazard reduction strategies at two different time scales. This allows us to
model individual level interactions in the local context of the COVID-19 pandemic, opening
a closed system to external forces.
Our model provides realistic estimates of SARS-COV-2 outbreaks and the ability to discover
novel control strategies. By integrating models at multiple scales, our simulation engine
empowers decision makers to develop location specific preparedness policies based on
realistic estimates of how SARS-COV-2 will spread through their institutions.},language={en},author={Schwantes, Collin J. and Lee, Benno and Ortiz, Benjamin and Willner, Marjorie and Pavon-Harr, Viveca},month={jan},year={2021},file={Glasgow - North American Social Network (NASN) Conference 20.pdf:/Users/collinschwantes/Zotero/storage/VZQMR9SB/Glasgow - North American Social Network (NASN) Conference 20.pdf:application/pdf}}
